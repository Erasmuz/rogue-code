# How to Install Arduino Libraries #

[From Arduino.cc](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Environment#libraries):

> To install these third-party libraries, create a directory called libraries within your sketchbook directory. Then unzip the library there. For example, to install the DateTime library, its files should be in the /libraries/DateTime sub-folder of your sketchbook folder.
